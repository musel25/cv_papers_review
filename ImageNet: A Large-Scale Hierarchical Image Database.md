## 1. Context & Background  
- **Problem:**  
  Prior to ImageNet, computer vision research was limited by the absence of a large-scale, diverse, and accurately annotated image dataset. Existing datasets were too small and narrowly focused to effectively train robust models.  
- **Importance:**  
  ImageNet filled this gap by providing a massive, hierarchically organized database that enabled the development of more advanced image recognition models, ultimately sparking the deep learning revolution in computer vision.  


## 2. Research Question & Hypothesis  
- **Research Question:**  
  Can a large-scale, hierarchically structured image dataset significantly improve the performance and training of visual recognition systems?  
- **Hypothesis:**  
  A dataset containing millions of images organized according to the semantic structure of WordNet will provide the necessary diversity and scale to train deep learning models that outperform those trained on smaller datasets.  


## 3. Methodology  
- **Data Collection:**  
  Images were collected from the internet using multiple search engines and a wide array of keywords (in various languages) to ensure extensive category coverage.  
- **Annotation:**  
  Crowdsourcing via platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk was used for annotation. Annotators verified the presence of objects and outlined them with bounding boxes. Multiple annotations per image ensured higher accuracy.  
- **Hierarchical Organization:**  
  Utilizing the WordNet hierarchy, images were grouped into synsets (concept categories), aiming for a high number of images per category to comprehensively represent each concept.
